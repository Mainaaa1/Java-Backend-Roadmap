# Day 2 — Java Collections and Exception Handling

This folder focuses on **Java Collections** and **Exception Handling**, two core areas used extensively in backend development. The goal is to understand how Java manages groups of data in memory and how applications handle unexpected or invalid runtime scenarios safely.

These concepts are foundational for working with databases, APIs, and frameworks such as Spring Boot.

## Topics Covered

### Java Collections Framework
- `List` (ordered collections, duplicates allowed)
- `Set` (unique elements)
- `Map` (key–value pairs)
- Iteration using loops and enhanced for-each
- Choosing the right collection based on use case

### Exception Handling
- Checked vs unchecked exceptions
- `try`, `catch`, `finally` blocks
- Throwing custom exceptions
- Using exceptions to enforce business rules
