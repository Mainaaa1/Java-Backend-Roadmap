# Classes — Java Class Fundamentals

This folder contains foundational Java examples focused on **defining and using classes**, which are the core building blocks of object-oriented programming in Java. The examples here are designed to demonstrate how data (state) and behavior are encapsulated within classes and how objects are created and interacted with at runtime.

---

## Concepts Demonstrated

The classes in this folder intentionally focus on the following fundamentals:

### Class Definition
- Declaring classes using the `class` keyword  
- Following Java naming and file-structure conventions  
- One public class per source file  

### Fields (Instance Variables)
- Defining class-level variables to represent object state  
- Using appropriate data types (`String`, `int`, `double`, etc.)  
- Applying access modifiers (`private`) to protect internal state  

### Constructors
- Initializing objects using constructors  
- Using constructor parameters to set initial field values  
- Applying the `this` keyword to distinguish instance variables from parameters  

### Methods (Behavior)
- Defining instance methods to represent object behavior  
- Encapsulating logic within methods  
- Returning values and modifying object state  

### Encapsulation
- Restricting direct access to fields  
- Exposing controlled access through public methods  
- Ensuring object state remains valid  

### Object Creation and Usage
- Instantiating objects using the `new` keyword  
- Calling methods on objects  
- Demonstrating interaction between multiple classes

## Scope and Design Principles

- The examples are deliberately **simple and focused**, emphasizing core class mechanics only.
- Advanced OOP concepts such as inheritance, interfaces, and polymorphism are intentionally excluded and covered in separate folders.
- Each class models a small, real-world concept (e.g., person, student, bank account) to reinforce practical object modeling.
- Code follows standard Java conventions to emphasize readability and maintainability.

## Learning Objectives

By working through the examples in this folder, the learner should be able to:

- Confidently define and structure Java classes  
- Create and initialize objects correctly  
- Encapsulate data and behavior within a class  
- Understand how multiple classes collaborate within a program  
- Write clean, idiomatic Java code  

This folder serves as the **foundation for more advanced object-oriented concepts** explored later in the roadmap, including inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces, and Spring Boot development.
